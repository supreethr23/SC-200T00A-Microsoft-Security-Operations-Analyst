# Module 9 - Lab 1 - Exercise 1 - Modify a Microsoft Security rule

## Lab scenario

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You must learn how to detect and mitigate threats using Microsoft Sentinel. First, you need to filter the alerts coming from Defender for Cloud into Microsoft Sentinel, by Severity. 

>**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/SC-200%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Modify%20a%20Microsoft%20Security%20rule)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same.

>**Important:** The lab exercises for Learning Path #9 are in a *standalone* environment. If you exit the lab before completing it, you will be required to re-run the configurations again.

## Lab objectives
