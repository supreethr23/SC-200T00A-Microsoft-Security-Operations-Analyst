# Module 9 - Lab 1 - Exercise 2 - Create a Playbook in Microsoft Sentinel

## Lab scenario

You're a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You must learn how to detect and mitigate threats using Microsoft Sentinel. Now, you want to respond and reMediate actions that can be run from Microsoft Sentinel as a routine.

With a playbook, you can help automate and orchestrate your threat response, integrate with other systems both internal and external, and can be set to run automatically in response to specific alerts or incidents, when triggered by an analytics rule or an automation rule, respectively.

>**Important:** The lab exercises for Learning Path #9 are in a *standalone* environment. If you exit the lab before completing it, you will be required to re-run the configurations again.

## Lab Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:
- Task 1: Create a Playbook in Microsoft Sentinel
- Task 2: Update a Playbook in Microsoft Sentinel
- Task 3: Create an Automation Rule

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes

1. Select Save on the command bar. The Logic App will be used in a future lab.

    ![](../Media/21.png)

### Task 3: Create an Automation Rule

In this task, you will create an automation rule in Microsoft Sentinel that runs a playbook based on specific tactics.

1. Within Microsoft Sentinel, go to Automation under Configuration.

1. Select **+ Create (1)** and choose **Automation Rule (2)**.

   ![](../Media/17.png)

1. Give the rule a name as **myautomationrule<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**

1. Leave the incident provider as All.

1. Leave the Analytic rule name as All.

1. Click Add and choose And.

    ![](../Media/18.png)

1. From the drop down, select **Tactics (1)**.

1. Select the **Contains (2)** operator from the dropdown.

1. Select the following tactics **(3)**:
