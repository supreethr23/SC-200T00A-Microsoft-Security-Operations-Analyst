# Module 9 - Lab 1 - Exercise 8 - Investigate Incidents

## Lab scenario

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You already created Scheduled and Microsoft Security Analytics rules. The Fusion and Anomalies Analytics rules are also enabled in your environment. Now is the time to investigate the Incidents created by them.

An incident can include multiple alerts. It is an aggregation of all the relevant evidence for a specific investigation. The properties related to the alerts, such as severity and status, are set at the incident level. After you let Microsoft Sentinel know what kinds of threats you are looking for and how to find them, you can monitor detected threats by investigating incidents.

>**Important:** The lab exercises for Learning Path #9 are in a *standalone* environment. If you exit the lab before completing it, you will be required to re-run the configurations again.

## Lab objectives
 In this lab, you will Understand the following:
 - Task 1: Investigate an incident

## Estimated timing: 20 minutes
