# Module 1 - Lab 1 - Exercise 1 - Explore Microsoft 365 Defender 

## Lab scenario

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that is implementing Microsoft 365 Defender. You start by assigning preset security policies in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365.

### Obtain Your Microsoft 365 Credentials

Once you launch the lab, a free trial tenant will be made available to you to access in the Microsoft Virtual Lab environment. This tenant will be automatically assigned a unique username and password. You must retrieve this username and password so that you can sign in to Azure and Microsoft 365 within the Microsoft Virtual Lab environment. 

Because this course can be offered by learning partners using any one of several Authorized Lab Hosting (ALH) providers, the actual steps involved to retrieve the tenant ID associated with your tenant may vary by lab hosting provider. Therefore, your instructor will provide you with the necessary instructions for how to retrieve this information for your course. The information that you should note for later use includes:

- **Tenant suffix ID.** This ID is for the onmicrosoft.com accounts that you will use to sign in to Microsoft 365 throughout the labs. This is in the format of **{username}@ZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com**, where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant suffix ID provided by your lab hosting provider. Record this ZZZZZZ value for later use. When any of the lab steps direct you to sign in to Microsoft 365 portals, you must enter the ZZZZZZ value that you obtained here.
- **Tenant password.** This is the password for the admin account provided by your lab hosting provider.

### Create a Group 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the **Sign in** dialog box, copy and paste in the **Username** provided in the environment details page (odl_user_DID@xxxxx.onmicrosoft.com) and then select Next.

### Task 2: Apply Microsoft Defender for Office 365 preset security policies

In this task, you will assign preset security policies for Exchange Online Protection (EOP) and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 in the Microsoft 365 security portal.

1. In the Edge browser, go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at (https://security.microsoft.com).

1. In the **Enter password** dialog box, copy and paste in the admin's tenant password provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Sign in**.

    >**Note:** If you receive a message "The operation could not be completed. Please try again later. If the problem persists, contact Microsoft support." just click **OK** to continue.  

1. If shown, close the Microsoft 365 Defender quick tour.

1. From the navigation menu, under *Email & Collaboration* area, select **Policies & rules**.

1. On the *Policy & rules* dashboard, select **Threat policies**.

1. On the *Threat policies* dashboard, select **Preset Security Policies**.

    >**Note:** If you receive the message *"Client Error - Error when getting bip rule"* select **OK** to continue. The error is due to the hydration status of your tenant at Office 365 which is not enabled by default.

1. Under **Standard protection**, select **Manage protection settings**. **Hint:** If you see this option grayed out, refresh your browser using **Ctrl+F5**.

    >**Note:** After clicking on **Manage protection settings**, we might need to wait for 20-25 minutes and if it is still in the loading stage we may need to sign out of Microsoft defender and sign in again and then try repeating the steps again to move forward. 

1. In the *Apply Exchange Online Protection* section, select **Specific recipients** and under **Domains** start writing your tenant's domain name, select it, and then select **Next**. **Hint:** Your tenant's domain name is the same that you have for your admin account, it might be something like *mocholxxxxx.onmicrosoft.com*. Notice that this configuration applies policies for anti-spam, outbound spam filters, anti-malware, and anti-phishing. 

1. In the **Apply Defender for Office 365 protection** section, apply the same configuration as the previous step and select **Next**. Notice that this configuration applies policies for anti-phishing, Safe Attachments, and Safe Links.

1. In the *Impersonation protection* section, select **Next** four times (4x) to continue.

1. In the *Policy mode* section, make sure the **Turn on the policy after I finish** radio button is selected, and then select **Next**.

1. Read the content under *Review and confirm your changes* and select **Confirm** to apply the changes and then select **Done** to finish.

### Task 3: Preparing the Microsoft 365 Defender workspace

1. On the **Microsoft 365 Defender** portal, from the navigation menu, select **Settings** from the left.

1. On the **Settings** page select **Microsoft 365 Defender**. You are going to see an image of a coffee mug and a message that reads: *Hang on! We're preparing new spaces for your data and connecting them.*. It will take several minutes to finish, so leave the page open but make sure it finishes since it is required for the next Lab. 

    >**Note:** If you get the error message "We didn't plan it will fail, but something went wrong." retry the step later or do it before the next Lab.

1. When the new space completes successfully, you are going to see the Microsoft 365 Defender settings for Account, Email notifications, Preview features, and Streaming API.

## You have completed the lab.
