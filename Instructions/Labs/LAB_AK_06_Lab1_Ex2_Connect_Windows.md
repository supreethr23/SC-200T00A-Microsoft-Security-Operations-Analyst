# Module 6 - Lab 1 - Exercise 2 - Connect Windows devices to Microsoft Sentinel using data connectors

## Lab scenario
  
 You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You must learn how to connect log data from the many data sources in your organization. The next source of data is Windows virtual machines inside and outside of Azure, like On-Premises environments or other Public Clouds.

## Lab objective
 In this lab, you will connect to Windows virtual machines, both within and outside of Azure, to Microsoft Sentinel using data connectors.

## Estimated timing: 40 minutes
