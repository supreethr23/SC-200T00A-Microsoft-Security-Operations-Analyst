### Prerequisite 01

### Task 1: Connect a non-Azure Windows Machine

In this task, you will install Azure Arc and connect a non-Azure Windows virtual machine to Microsoft Sentinel.  

   >**Important:** The next steps are done on a different machine than the one you were previously working on. Look for the Virtual Machine name references.

   >**Important:** The *Windows Security Events via AMA* data connector requires Azure Arc for non-Azure devices. 

1. In the lab virtual machine, Select **WINserver** from the desktop.
